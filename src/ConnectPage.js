                    <br/>
                    We post one song a day, hopefully you havenâ€™t heard, but will love.

                    Our team consists of huge music lovers who spend hours each day digging through tracks to uncover old and new gems. While dance music inspired us to create this site, we won't hesitate to post songs from any genre if we feel you'll dig it.

                    RWT believes in the power of music. We believe music is often the foundation for memorable moments in our lives...hanging with friends and family, epic road trips, a simple day at the beach, and life's most important celebrations. Rock With This hopes to make those times a bit more memorable.

                    Rock on and Rock With This.</p>
